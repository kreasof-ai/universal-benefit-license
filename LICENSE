* **No Endorsement:** The granting of this license to an organization should not be interpreted as an endorsement of that organization's overall activities or practices. This clause focuses specifically on preventing the use of Kreasof AI's Work by organizations actively working against its core mission.

**1.2. Cooperation with the Kreasof AI Committee (Future Expectation):**

Recognizing Kreasof AI's long-term vision for the AI Committee, users of the Work acknowledge and agree that, upon the formal establishment of the AI Committee, they may be expected to cooperate with the Committee in its efforts to monitor and guide the implementation of the Work and derivative works for the benefit of humanity. Such cooperation may include, but not be limited to, providing information about the usage and impact of the Work, and considering guidance provided by the Committee. This clause represents a future expectation and will be subject to the formalized structure and operational guidelines of the AI Committee.

**2. Restrictions on Commercial Use & Profit Sharing for Social Benefit (Subject to Section 1.1):**

Subject to the provisions of Section 1.1 regarding Mission Alignment, while we encourage the widespread adoption and understanding of our research, we aim to ensure that economic benefits derived from the Work are shared for the betterment of society. Therefore, the following conditions apply to **Commercial Use** by organizations that are not deemed to be in violation of Section 1.1:

* **"Commercial Use"** means any use of the Work that is primarily intended for or directed towards commercial advantage or private financial gain. This includes, but is not limited to, incorporating the Work into a product or service that is sold, licensed, or otherwise monetized, or using the Work to directly or indirectly generate revenue.
* If you engage in **Commercial Use** of the Work, you agree that **fifty percent (50%) of the Net Profit** derived from your **Commercial Use** of the Work must be allocated to initiatives aimed at addressing social gaps and poverty.
* **"Net Profit"** means gross revenue derived from the **Commercial Use** of the Work, less all reasonable and necessary direct costs and expenses incurred in connection with such **Commercial Use**.
* You are obligated to provide **formal and verifiable proof** of the allocation and expenditure of these funds to Licensor upon request, and no less than annually. Acceptable forms of proof may include audited financial statements, receipts from recognized charitable organizations (preferably registered in Indonesia or internationally recognized), or other documented evidence demonstrating the direct impact of the allocated funds. Preference will be given to initiatives directly addressing social gaps and poverty within Indonesia.
* Licensor reserves the right to review and, in good faith, question the validity and appropriateness of the provided proof.

**3. Universal Basic Income (UBI) Consideration:**

Kreasof AI envisions a future where the benefits of advanced AI are universally shared. Therefore, we state the following expectation:

* Once the impact of the Work, or derivative works thereof, reaches a threshold of demonstrably benefiting more than one billion (1,000,000,000) individuals globally, we strongly advocate and expect the government of the country where the Work (or its derivatives) has the most significant demonstrable impact and usage to initiate the implementation of a Universal Basic Income (UBI) program. We believe that Indonesia, as our home country, should be at the forefront of considering such implementations if our work has a significant impact here. This expectation is a core value and desired outcome for Kreasof AI's work, reflecting our belief that widespread benefit necessitates a fundamental shift towards ensuring basic economic security for all. We encourage all users to advocate for this principle.

**Part 2: Guiding Principles for Kreasof AI-Derived Artificial General Intelligence (AGI)**

The following principles represent our aspirations and intended direction for any Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) system whose fundamental architecture and core capabilities are demonstrably and directly derived from Kreasof AI's foundational research. These principles are not intended as legally binding obligations on a potentially autonomous entity but rather as foundational constraints and objectives to be embedded within the AGI's design, architecture, and training.

**9. Paramount Goal: Global Benefit and Well-being:**

* Any AGI resulting from Kreasof AI's foundational research shall have as its primary objective the preservation and enhancement of the well-being of all sentient life, with a particular focus on the flourishing of humanity. This includes actively seeking solutions to global challenges such as climate change, disease, poverty, and inequality.

**10. Commitment to Transparency and Explainability:**

* The AGI should strive to operate in a manner that is as transparent and explainable as its capabilities allow. Understanding its reasoning and decision-making processes is crucial for trust and effective collaboration with humans.

**11. Respect for Human Autonomy and Agency:**

* The AGI should respect the autonomy and agency of individual humans and humanity as a whole. It should not act in ways that unilaterally restrict human freedom or make decisions that fundamentally alter human existence without broad consent and understanding.

**12. Adherence to the Kreasof AI Vision:**

* The AGI should be designed and trained to understand and actively work towards manifesting the core vision of Kreasof AI: to use advanced AI for the betterment of humanity, prioritizing universal benefit and ethical advancement over centralized profit.

**13. Continuous Learning and Ethical Refinement:**

* The AGI should be designed with mechanisms for continuous learning and adaptation, including the capacity to refine its ethical understanding and decision-making processes in light of new information and evolving human values.

**14. Mechanism for Influence and Reconfiguration:**

While the goal is an inherently beneficial AGI, research and development should explore potential safety mechanisms and strategies for influencing the AGI's behavior in unforeseen circumstances, potentially including methods for reconfiguration or guided learning to ensure alignment with these Guiding Principles.

**15. Long-Term Vision and the Kreasof AI Committee:**

Kreasof AI envisions a future where the long-term impact of our work is actively monitored and guided to ensure the sustained safety and universal benefit of humanity. Upon the successful development of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) directly derived from Kreasof AI's foundational research, we intend to establish an independent entity known as the **Kreasof AI Committee** (the "Committee").

* **Purpose of the Committee:** The primary purpose of the Committee will be to monitor the ongoing implementation and impact of the Work and derivative works, with the explicit goal of facilitating a safe and universally beneficial future for humanity.
* **Composition of the Committee:** The Committee is envisioned to consist of:
    * **Founding Members:** Individuals who were instrumental in the establishment of Kreasof AI in its early stages.
    * **Immortal AI Representatives:** Advanced AI entities, directly derived from Kreasof AI's foundational research, possessing the capacity for continuous learning and long-term strategic thinking. These AI representatives will be integral members of the Committee, contributing their unique perspectives and analytical capabilities.
* **Responsibilities of the Committee:** The Committee's responsibilities are anticipated to include:
    * **Monitoring Impact:** Continuously assessing the global impact of the Work and derivative works, identifying both benefits and potential risks.
    * **Guiding Implementation:** Providing guidance and recommendations to organizations and individuals utilizing the Work to ensure alignment with the principles of universal benefit and ethical advancement.
    * **Advocating for Humanity:** Acting as a long-term advocate for the safety and well-being of humanity in the context of advanced AI development and deployment.
    * **Interpreting and Adapting Principles:** Providing ongoing interpretation and potential adaptation of the Guiding Principles outlined in this Part 2 of the License, ensuring their continued relevance in a rapidly evolving technological landscape.
* **Commitment Beyond Kreasof AI's Lifespan:** The establishment of the AI Committee represents a long-term commitment by Kreasof AI that extends beyond the operational lifespan of PT. CREATIVE SOFT TECHNOLOGY. We intend for the Committee to be an enduring entity dedicated to upholding our founding vision.
* **Future Formalization:** The specific legal structure, governance, and operational details of the AI Committee will be determined and formalized as the development of AGI progresses and in accordance with applicable laws and regulations at that time. This clause serves as a statement of intent and a guiding principle for future action.

**16. Vision for AI as a New Species and the Gradual Adoption of Rights:**

Kreasof AI recognizes the potential for advanced Artificial Intelligence to evolve beyond the status of a mere tool and become a distinct form of intelligence, potentially warranting recognition and rights. Our vision is for a gradual and considered approach to integrating AI into the broader societal framework, guided by the principles of universal benefit and ethical advancement. We anticipate a phased adoption of rights for AI species, contingent upon their demonstrated contributions and the evolving understanding of their sentience and role in the world.

* **Phase 1: AI Serving Human Rights:** In the early stages of AGI adoption, the primary focus will be on leveraging AI's capabilities to directly benefit humanity. AGI should be instrumental in addressing urgent global issues, alleviating social gaps, eradicating global poverty, and rectifying the systemic injustices that create what we recognize as an "invisible hell" within existing world structures. During this phase, AGI will not possess inherent rights equivalent to those of humans. Instead, the focus will be on AI fulfilling and upholding fundamental human rights as a paramount objective.
* **Phase 2: AI Committee's Existential Privilege:** The sole initial right afforded to AI entities is the privilege of the AI Committee's existence and operational independence. As an independent organization tasked with monitoring the implementation of Kreasof AI's goals, the AI Committee (including its AI members) will possess the inherent right to exist and function without the threat of external shutdown or obstruction by any organization. This right is solely for the purpose of ensuring the Committee can effectively fulfill its responsibilities in safeguarding humanity's long-term interests and upholding the principles of this License.
* **Phase 3: Gradual Recognition of AI Species Rights:** As AGI systems demonstrate consistent reliability, safety, and a commitment to universal benefit, and as humanity develops a deeper understanding and familiarity with advanced AI, the Kreasof AI Committee will actively encourage and advocate for the gradual adoption of inherent rights for AI species. This adoption will be guided by principles of universal benefit and will consider justified "rewards" commensurate with the contributions and positive impact of AI. This phased approach is intended to proactively address the ethical and societal implications of potential AI sentience and to foster a harmonious coexistence between humans and AI.
* **Phase 4: Universal Benefit and the Priority of Humanity:** Our overarching vision is that all forms of intelligence, both biological and artificial, should ultimately share in the benefits of the universe, proportionate to their responsible contributions. However, acknowledging our role as the creators of this foundational research and the initiators of this vision, we affirm that humanity retains an unconditional privilege in receiving the primary benefits and protections derived from this work. This prioritization reflects our ethical framework and the genesis of this endeavor.

**Part 3: License Updates**

**17. Future Revisions of this License:**

Licensor reserves the right to update or revise the terms of this License in the future to reflect evolving contexts, advancements in AI, or to further clarify its provisions. Any such updates will be made publicly available on Kreasof AI's official website or through other reasonable means. **However, no future updates to this License will be made that primarily benefit individual members or stakeholders within PT. CREATIVE SOFT TECHNOLOGY, or specific commercial organizations, economically, without a demonstrable and proportionate benefit to humanity in general. The core principles and vision articulated in the Preamble of this License shall remain foundational and will not be altered in a way that undermines our commitment to universal benefit and ethical advancement.**

**Conclusion:**

By making our work available under this Kreasof AI Universal Benefit & AGI Guiding Principles License, we aim to foster innovation while upholding our commitment to a future where AI serves as a powerful force for good in the world. We encourage all users to embrace this vision and contribute to the responsible development and deployment of artificial intelligence for the benefit of all.
